# 6. Decision log & how the design evolved

This maps the open items in [brief §7](../PROJECT-BRIEF.md) to decisions (with the spec
section that implements them) and records the **two big pivots** that happened after the
brief/first-draft spec: the data source moved off EWGF, and the project became multi-site.

## 6.1 Decisions made in this spec

## 6.2 The two pivots (post-research)

### Pivot 1 — data source: EWGF → tknow.gg (+ Wavu, + opt-in ewgf)

The first spec draft (and files 2–4's original text) treated EWGF's public API as the
primary source for both ranks and matches. Research killed that: EWGF's free tier caps
at the **last 50 battles (24h delayed)** and its profile endpoint (Pro-only) exposes
only the _main_ character's rank — insufficient for full per-character rank + match
history. See the **🛑 SUPERSEDED** banner in [§7.2](./07-external-api-reference.md#72-ewgf--recent-battles-drives-ranks--matches).

Resolution (current):

1. **Ranks + quick/ranked matches → tknow.gg** ([§7.9](./07-external-api-reference.md#79-tknowgg--the-live-source-for-ranks--matches-verified-2026-07-01)):
   free, un-gated (soft `Origin`/`Referer` check, **no API key**), real per-character dan
   ranks + lifetime games, and paginated `battle_id`-keyed match history.
2. **MMR → Wavu Wank** ([§7.3](./07-external-api-reference.md#73-wavu-wank--glicko-2-mmr-μ--σ2)):
   HTML scrape, anonymous, publishes μ/σ² + confidence buckets.
3. **Group/player (custom-lobby) matches → ewgf** ([§8](./08-ewgf-group-player-matches.md)):
   tknow surfaces only quick/ranked, so the _deliberate_ crew-vs-crew lobby fights come
   from ewgf's public API — **opt-in per site** (`headToHead.enabled` + `EWGF_API_KEY`),
   because its free tier is ~100 req/day. So `ewgf.ts` and `EWGF_API_KEY` do exist, but
   in a **narrow, optional** role — not as the primary source the old spec described.

`EWGF_API_KEY` is therefore no longer "the one true blocking external dependency" the
first draft framed it as: the core site (ranks, MMR, quick/ranked matches) needs **no**
key at all; the key only unlocks the H2H feature for a site that opts in.

### Pivot 2 — single-site → multi-site

The crew grew past one group. Rather than fork the repo, the app was parameterized by a
`SITE` env var with layered config and per-site `data/` folders (§1.2). Data moved from
`public/data/` to `sites/<slug>/data/`; `public/` now holds only shared static assets.

## 6.3 Explicitly deferred (brief §3 non-goals / §8 stretch)

Not in scope: accounts/auth, public ladder, in-browser submit, multi-game, brackets,
mobile app. Stretch (post-v1): crew stats dashboard, rivalry-of-the-week, tournament
page, badges, Discord integration, extra filters. The schemas here don't preclude any
of them — e.g. `stats.json` already carries the data a dashboard would need.
