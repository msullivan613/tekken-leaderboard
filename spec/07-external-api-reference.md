# 7. External API reference (verified)

> **📌 Current source hierarchy (read this first).** The pipeline sources:
>
> - **in-game rank + quick/ranked matches → tknow.gg** (§7.9) — no API key.
> - **MMR → Wavu Wank** (§7.3) — no API key.
> - **group/player (custom-lobby) matches → ewgf.gg** ([§8](./08-ewgf-group-player-matches.md))
>   — opt-in per site, needs `EWGF_API_KEY`.
>
> Sections **7.2, 7.4, and 7.8 are historical** — they describe the abandoned
> EWGF-as-primary design (see the 🛑 banner in §7.2 and the pivot writeup in §6.2).
> The rank ladder (§7.5), character list (§7.6), identity (§7.1), and "build history
> from our own snapshots" (§7.7) notes are still current and used by the code.

Everything here was **observed from the live services / EWGF's open-source code**
on 2026-06-30 (EWGF/Wavu) and 2026-07-01 (tknow) using the crew's own account
(SugarFree, Tekken ID `3fee-J699-M7An`).

Sources: [`ewgf-gg/ewgfgg-backend`](https://github.com/ewgf-gg/ewgfgg-backend),
[`ewgf-gg/ewgfgg-frontend`](https://github.com/ewgf-gg/ewgfgg-frontend),
`https://wank.wavu.wiki/player/3feeJ699M7An`.

## 7.1 Player identity — the two ID forms

| Where                 | Form     | Example          |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Tekken in-game / EWGF | dashed   | `3fee-J699-M7An` |
| Wavu Wank URL         | undashed | `3feeJ699M7An`   |

**📌 Decision:** `players.json.tekken_id` stores the **dashed** form
(`3fee-J699-M7An`); the pipeline derives the undashed form for Wavu with
`tekken_id.replaceAll('-', '')`. EWGF's route accepts either form (both matched,
returning 401 for auth rather than 404).

Steam id is also exposed on the Wavu page (`steamcommunity.com/profiles/<steamId>`)
— useful for populating `platform` and cross-checking identity when onboarding.

---

## 7.2 EWGF — recent battles (drives ranks + matches)

> **🛑 SUPERSEDED (2026-07-01) — the pipeline no longer uses EWGF.** EWGF's free
> tier caps at the last 50 battles (24h delayed) and its `/external/profile`
> endpoint (Pro-only) exposes only the _main_ character's rank, not per-character
> dan ranks — so it couldn't satisfy either goal (full match history / real
> per-character rank). We switched ranks **and** matches to **tknow.gg** (§7.9),
> which is free, un-gated, gives real per-character dan ranks + lifetime games,
> and a paginated `battle_id`-keyed match history. Wavu (§7.3) still drives MMR.
> The `ewgf.ts` client and `EWGF_API_KEY` secret have been removed. The EWGF notes
> below are retained for historical context only.

> **⚠️ Requires an API key.** The **public** EWGF API lives at `api.ewgf.gg`
> behind an auth gateway: every request returns **HTTP 401**
> (`{"error":"Unauthorized access."}`) without `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Keys
> are self-serve — create an account and generate one under Settings → Developer.
> (The `/player-stats/*` routes seen in `ewgfgg-backend` are the site's _internal_
> API, not exposed publicly; the public surface is the `/external/*` routes below.)
> Docs: <https://ewgf.gg/api-docs>. See the §7.4 decision.

- **Base URL:** `https://api.ewgf.gg`
- **Endpoint (used):** `GET /external/battles/{tekkenId}` → `{ _metadata, data: EwgfBattle[] }`
- **Headers:** `Accept: application/json`, `Authorization: Bearer <EWGF_API_KEY>`
- **Other endpoints (not used):** `GET /external/profile/{tekkenId}` and
  `POST /external/profile` return profile metadata but are **Pro-tier only** (they
  500/deny on the free tier), so we don't depend on them.
- **Tiers / limits:** Free = **100 req/day**, player's **last 50 battles, 24h
  delayed**, no profile metadata. Pro ($10/mo) = 1,000 req/day, last 100, no delay.
  Every response carries a `_metadata` object (`rate_limit_remaining`,
  `rate_limit_reset`, `tier`).
- **Id verification:** the public API has **no name search**. A member's
  `tekken_id` is the id in their profile URL (`https://ewgf.gg/player/<tekken_id>`);
  `npm run resolve-id -- "<tekken_id>"` confirms it resolves (fetches battles, prints
  the display name + characters seen).

### `EwgfBattle` — one online match to 3 rounds (verified live)

The battles response is the **sole source** for both `ranks.json` (rank/usage are
_derived_ from the battle list — see below) and `matches.json`/`stats.json`.

```ts
interface EwgfBattle {
  battle_at: string; // ISO-8601 UTC, e.g. "2026-06-21T03:56:41Z"
  battle_type: string; // "QUICK_BATTLE" | "RANKED_BATTLE" | "GROUP_BATTLE" | "PLAYER_BATTLE"
  game_version?: number;
  winner: number; // 1 | 2
  stage_id?: number;
  p1_name: string;
  p1_tekken_id: string; // tekken_id is UNDASHED, e.g. "3feeJ699M7An"
  p1_char: string; // display name, e.g. "Bryan" (canonical, §7.6)
  p1_region: string | null; // e.g. "Americas"
  p1_dan_rank: string | null; // display name, e.g. "Tekken God" (§7.5)
  p1_tekken_power?: number;
  p1_rounds_won: number;
  p2_name: string;
  p2_tekken_id: string;
  p2_char: string;
  p2_region: string | null;
  p2_dan_rank: string | null;
  p2_tekken_power?: number;
  p2_rounds_won: number;
}
```

Notes (all verified against the live free-tier endpoint):

- **Character and rank are _names_, not ids** — map via `canonicalizeCharacter`
  (§7.6) and `rankFromName` (§7.5). `characterId`/integer-`danRank` are internal-API
  concepts and do **not** appear here.
- **`p1`/`p2` orientation is stable across feeds:** a crew-vs-crew battle appears in
  both players' lists with identical p1/p2/winner/rounds, so it's deduped by the
  synthetic key `{p1_tekken_id}:{p2_tekken_id}:{epochSeconds}` (§4.2).
- **No `battleId`** and **no per-character lifetime totals** (profile is Pro-only).

**Deriving `ranks.json` (§2.4) from battles** — for each character a tracked player
appears on in their recent battles:

| our field           | derived from the player's own battles on that character               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `character`         | `canonicalizeCharacter(p{1,2}_char)` (§7.6)                           |
| `rank` / `rankTier` | `rankFromName(dan_rank)` of their **most recent** battle on it (§7.5) |
| `rankedGames`       | count of `RANKED_BATTLE` battles seen in the window                   |
| `region`            | `region` of their most recent battle                                  |
| `characterPeakRank` | running max of `rankTier` across daily snapshots — see note           |
| `lastSeen`          | `battle_at` of their most recent battle on it                         |

> **Free-tier caveat:** `rankedGames` reflects only the **last-50 battle window**,
> not lifetime totals, so a player whose recent games are all PLAYER/QUICK battles
> can show `rankedGames: 0` yet still have a valid `rank` (from the latest battle's
> `dan_rank`). The `pairThreshold.minRankedGames` gate is satisfied via
> `max(EWGF windowed games, Wavu lifetime games)`, so Wavu's lifetime count keeps
> established players on the board.

> **Note — peak rank:** the public API exposes no all-time per-character peak.
> **📌 Decision:** derive `peak_rank` as the **running max of `rankTier`** we observe
> across our own daily snapshots (`rankhistory.json`), with the hand-set
> `players.json` value as the floor/fallback — correct going forward regardless.

## 7.3 Wavu Wank — Glicko-2 MMR (μ / σ²)

> **⚠️ No JSON API for per-player data.** `?_format=json` returns the **HTML page**
> (`Content-Type: text/html`, verified), not JSON. The documented `/api/replays`
> endpoint is the global firehose, not per-player. So per-player MMR is obtained by
> **fetching and parsing the profile HTML.** Anonymous access works (no key).

- **URL:** `https://wank.wavu.wiki/player/{tekkenIdUndashed}`
- **Headers:** descriptive `User-Agent` (crew contact), `Accept-Encoding: gzip`.
- **Politeness / ToS:** daily, sequential, one request per player. Respect Wavu's ToS.

### Page structure (server-rendered, stable class names)

```html
<title>SugarFree • Wavu Wank</title>
<!-- steam id: -->
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043616016">
  ...
  <div class="rating-group">

                printDate(1781924751);
              </script></time
            ></sup
          >
        </div>
        <!-- unix secs -->
      </div>
      ...

  <!-- two more .rating-group blocks: -->
  <!--   label "Unqualified (σ² < 110)"  -->
  <!--   label "Provisional (σ² ≥ 110)"  --></a
>
```

### Parsing rules

- For each `.rating-group`, read `.label` → confidence bucket:
  `Leaderboard` → `"leaderboard"`, `Unqualified` → `"unqualified"`,
  `Provisional` → `"provisional"`.
- For each `.rating` inside: `.char` (text) → character; `.mu` → parse int after `μ`;
  `.sigma` → parse int after `σ²`; `.games` → parse leading int; `.last-seen` → the
  integer arg of `printDate(...)` is unix seconds → ISO.

**Mapping Wavu → our schema (§2.5 `glicko.json`):**

| our field     | from Wavu                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rating`      | `.mu` value                                                 |
| `deviation`   | **store σ² as-is** in a `sigmaSquared` field (see decision) |
| `confidence`  | the group label (`leaderboard`/`unqualified`/`provisional`) |
| `provisional` | `confidence === "provisional"`                              |
| `games`       | `.games` value                                              |
| `lastUpdated` | `printDate` unix → ISO                                      |

> **📌 Revised decision (glicko schema):** Wavu publishes **σ² (variance)**, not σ
> (RD), and already buckets each character into Leaderboard / Unqualified /
> Provisional. So:
>
> 1. Rename the schema field `deviation` → **`sigmaSquared`** (store the raw σ²), and
>    add **`confidence`** (the group). Drop the invented `PROVISIONAL_RD` cutoff — use
>    Wavu's own bucketing.
> 2. `provisional = confidence === "provisional"` drives the UI's uncertain-rating
>    styling (brief §5.5).
>    This supersedes §2.5's `deviation`/`volatility`/`provisional`-by-cutoff fields.

## 7.4 EWGF API-key decision (HISTORICAL)

> **🛑 SUPERSEDED.** This section reasoned about needing an `EWGF_API_KEY` for the
> _rank_ pipeline back when EWGF was the primary source. That's no longer true: ranks
> come from tknow (no key, §7.9). An `EWGF_API_KEY` still exists but now unlocks only
> the **opt-in group/player match** feature ([§8](./08-ewgf-group-player-matches.md)) —
> the core site works without it. Retained for context.

Because EWGF is fully gated, the automated rank pipeline **needs a key**.

> **📌 Decision — request a read API key from the EWGF team; store it as the GitHub
> Actions secret `EWGF_API_KEY`; degrade gracefully if absent.**
>
> - EWGF is a community project (active GitHub org + Discord). Ask for a low-volume
>   read key for a private crew tool. This keeps cost $0 (a secret, not a paid tier).
> - The workflow passes `EWGF_API_KEY` as an env var to the pipeline; it is **never**
>   shipped to the browser (the pipeline runs in Actions; only the resulting JSON is
>   published).
> - **Graceful degradation:** if `EWGF_API_KEY` is unset/invalid, `online-stats`
>   skips the EWGF step and still writes `glicko.json` from Wavu. The board then shows
>   `—` for in-game rank and sorts by MMR. Wavu (MMR, the headline chart) needs no
>   key, so the site is useful even without EWGF.
> - **Fallback if no key is granted:** launch **MMR-only v1** (Wavu), and revisit
>   in-game rank later (options: negotiate a key, or scrape the EWGF Next.js page with
>   a browser-like client — it 403s simple bots, so this is a last resort and must
>   respect their ToS).

**Action item for the human:** obtain `EWGF_API_KEY` (or confirm we're shipping
MMR-only v1). This is the one true external dependency that a spec can't resolve
alone.

## 7.5 Rank ladder — verified `rankOrderMap` (from EWGF frontend)

This map is `tier` → display name (higher = better). The **public** `/external`
API returns the rank as one of these **display names** (e.g. `"Tekken God"`), so
`rankFromName` reverse-looks it up to `{ slug, tier }`. (The integer
`currentSeasonDanRank` below is the _internal_ API's encoding, kept here because it
defines the ladder ordering and the `normalizeDanRank` folding.) Two quirks to
normalize on the integer side:

- `29..37` and `100..107` (+`765`) are **both** "God of Destruction …" encodings.
  Normalize the `100+`/`765` block down onto `29..37` for a single ordering
  (`tier = danRank >= 100 ? danRank - 71 : (danRank === 765 ? 37 : danRank)`).
- `currentSeasonDanRank` may be `null` (unranked this season) → `rank = null`,
  `rankTier = null` (the pair still counts toward the threshold via games).

```ts
export const rankOrderMap: Record<number, string> = {
  0: 'Beginner',
  1: '1st Dan',
  2: '2nd Dan',
  3: 'Fighter',
  4: 'Strategist',
  5: 'Combatant',
  6: 'Brawler',
  7: 'Ranger',
  8: 'Cavalry',
  9: 'Warrior',
  10: 'Assailant',
  11: 'Dominator',
  12: 'Vanquisher',
  13: 'Destroyer',
  14: 'Eliminator',
  15: 'Garyu',
  16: 'Shinryu',
  17: 'Tenryu',
  18: 'Mighty Ruler',
  19: 'Flame Ruler',
  20: 'Battle Ruler',
  21: 'Fujin',
  22: 'Raijin',
  23: 'Kishin',
  24: 'Bushin',
  25: 'Tekken King',
  26: 'Tekken Emperor',
  27: 'Tekken God',
  28: 'Tekken God Supreme',
  29: 'God of Destruction',
  30: 'God of Destruction I',
  31: 'God Of Destruction II',
  32: 'God of Destruction III',
  33: 'God of Destruction IV',
  34: 'God of Destruction V',
  35: 'God of Destruction VI',
  36: 'God of Destruction VII',
  37: 'God of Destruction Infinity',
  // alt encodings normalized onto 29..37:
  100: 'God of Destruction',
  101: 'God of Destruction I',
  102: 'God Of Destruction II',
  103: 'God of Destruction III',
  104: 'God of Destruction IV',
  105: 'God of Destruction V',
  106: 'God of Destruction VI',
  107: 'God of Destruction VII',
  765: 'God of Destruction Infinity',
};
```

EWGF also ships rank icon assets (`/static/rank-icons/<Name>T8.webp`). For our own
design (brief §4.1) we choose whether to reuse Tekken's official iconography or a
custom style — the _slug + tier_ stored in data is icon-agnostic.

---

## 7.6 Character list — display names (EWGF public API + Wavu agree)

The public `/external/battles` API returns characters as **display names**
(`p1_char`/`p2_char`, e.g. `"Bryan"`, `"Armor King"`, `"Miary Zo"`), and Wavu's
`.char` uses the **same** spellings. So character keying across the two providers is
1:1 on the name — `canonicalizeCharacter(name)` is the single mapper; the numeric
`characterIdMap` below (internal-API encoding) is retained for reference only and is
**not** used by the pipeline. The roster includes all live-observed names, incl.
`Armor King`, `Kunimitsu`, `Miary Zo`.

> **📌 Simplified decision:** the canonical key is the **EWGF/Wavu display name**
> (e.g. `"Devil Jin"`, `"Jack-8"`). Keep a slugify for URLs (`"devil_jin"`), but the
> heavy alias-map machinery in §2.1 is **not needed** — a small `displayName ⇄ slug`
> table suffices. Only add an alias if a future provider name is observed to differ.

```ts
export const characterIdMap: Record<number, string> = {
  0: 'Paul',
  1: 'Law',
  2: 'King',
  3: 'Yoshimitsu',
  4: 'Hwoarang',
  5: 'Xiaoyu',
  6: 'Jin',
  7: 'Bryan',
  8: 'Kazuya',
  9: 'Steve',
  10: 'Jack-8',
  11: 'Asuka',
  12: 'Devil Jin',
  13: 'Feng',
  14: 'Lili',
  15: 'Dragunov',
  16: 'Leo',
  17: 'Lars',
  18: 'Alisa',
  19: 'Claudio',
  20: 'Shaheen',
  21: 'Nina',
  22: 'Lee',
  23: 'Kuma',
  24: 'Panda',
  28: 'Zafina',
  29: 'Leroy',
  32: 'Jun',
  33: 'Reina',
  34: 'Azucena',
  35: 'Victor',
  36: 'Raven',
  38: 'Eddy',
  39: 'Lidia',
  40: 'Heihachi',
  41: 'Clive',
  42: 'Anna',
  43: 'Fahkumram' /* + any later DLC ids */,
};
```

---

## 7.7 History — neither provider gives a per-character time series

- **EWGF** exposes only `currentSeasonDanRank` + `previousSeasonDanRank` (and a
  `battles` list) — no daily rank series.
- **Wavu** shows only the _current_ μ/σ² per character (plus a per-character
  last-seen) — no rating history in the profile scrape.

So both `rankhistory.json` and `mmrhistory.json` **must** be built from our own daily
snapshots (exactly as §2.6/§2.7/§3.4 already specify). This confirms — rather than
changes — the snapshot design; there's no shortcut series to import. The very first
run seeds day 1; the charts grow from there.

## 7.9 tknow.gg — the live source for ranks + matches (verified 2026-07-01)

After EWGF proved insufficient (§7.2), the pipeline sources **both** in-game rank
and match history from **tknow.gg**, an independent Tekken-8 stats site with an
unofficial JSON API. Free, no API key, no Cloudflare challenge. Wavu (§7.3) still
drives MMR. Implemented in `scripts/online-stats/tknow.ts`.

- **Base URL:** `https://api.tk8now.pe.kr/api/v1` (the site's `api.tknow.gg` alias
  does not resolve publicly; the `.pe.kr` host is what the frontend falls back to).
- **Gate:** requests without an `Origin: https://www.tknow.gg` + `Referer:
https://www.tknow.gg/` header pair get `403 {"error":"The stars have not
foretold…"}`. This is a soft anti-hotlink check (no token). We send those headers
  plus a descriptive `User-Agent`. **ToS note:** unofficial API — keep it polite
  (sequential, one player at a time, low volume), same posture as the Wavu scrape.
  Consider giving the dev (min2hound; Discord/X linked on the site) a heads-up.

### `GET /player/info/{polarisId}` → per-character rank (drives `ranks.json`)

`current_ranks[]` gives, per character actually played:

| our field           | from tknow                                                                                                                                         |

| `rank` / `rankTier` | `rankFromDanRank(current_rank)` — `current_rank` is the **same integer ladder** as §7.5's `rankOrderMap` (27=Tekken God, 31=God of Destruction II) |
| `rankedGames`       | `total_games` — **lifetime** ranked games (not a windowed count → fixes the §7.2 free-tier caveat)                                                 |
| `region`            | `region_id` → name (0 Asia, 1 Middle East, 2 Oceania, 3 Americas, 4 Europe 1, 5 Africa, 6 Europe 2)                                                |
| `lastSeen`          | `latest_at` (unix seconds) → ISO                                                                                                                   |

Also returns `nickname`, `my_power`, `region_id`, and `latest_game_info.version_list`.
The match query version is `max(current_ranks[].last_play_version)`, falling back to
`max(version_list)`. **Unmapped `char_id`s** (e.g. reserved ids 25/26/27/30/31/37 for
unreleased characters — Bob, Roger Jr., Yujiro) are logged and skipped.

### `GET /player/match/{polarisId}?version={v}&page={n}` → matches (drives `matches.json`)

Newest-first, paginated match rows with a real **`battle_id`** (globally unique →
exact dedup, replacing the old synthetic `p1:p2:epoch` key). Fields we use:
`battle_at` (unix), `battle_type` (1 = quick, else ranked; lobby/player matches are
**not** tracked), `is_win`, and `my_/enemy_` `polaris_id` / `chara` / `rank` /
`rounds`. Each row is normalized to a canonical orientation (p1.polarisId ≤
p2.polarisId) so the same battle from either crew member's feed yields an identical
`Match`. **`version` is required and per-patch** (`all`/`0` are rejected), so we query
the player's latest version each run and paginate until a page adds nothing new or we
reach a `battle_id` we already stored (incremental catch-up; first run backfills the
current version's full history).

> **Crew-vs-crew caveat:** head-to-head only populates when two roster members meet
> in **ranked/quick matchmaking**. Custom-lobby sets aren't tracked by tknow (or
> EWGF), so a crew that plays each other in private rooms will show 0 crew matches.
